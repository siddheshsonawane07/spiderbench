# Spiderbench — a browser web-swinging game written by Claude

A non-commercial fan project and benchmark. It shows the kind of code and assets that **Claude** (Anthropic's AI model, working through Claude Code) can produce for a real-time 3D game running in the browser.

The code, shaders, procedural city, Blender-built models and generated textures were produced by Claude under the direction of a human, who steered the work through feedback and reference images.

## What's in it
- **Traversal:** third-person web-swinging, wall-running, perching, zipping and diving, driven by a custom physics and animation state machine.
- **City:** a procedural Manhattan-style island with an authored street network, including Broadway, Greenwich Village and the Financial District. It has thousands of buildings, rooftops, parks, Times Square, bridges, traffic and pedestrians.
- **Rendering:** a Three.js (WebGL2) pipeline with cascaded shadows, screen-space GI, AO and reflections, bloom, TAA, motion blur, fixed time-of-day presets (including night and rain), and a day/night city.
- **Assets:** character, vehicle and pedestrian models and animation clips built by Blender Python scripts, plus AI-generated textures and ad art. Advertised brands are invented, apart from in-universe Marvel names such as the Daily Bugle and Oscorp.

## Run it
Requires Node.js 20.19+ or 22.12+ and a WebGL2-capable browser. A discrete GPU is recommended.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # then open http://127.0.0.1:5173
npm run build    # production build in dist/
```

Controls are listed in-game (press **H**). On the dev server, **~** opens a developer menu (on a build, add `?dev` to the URL).

## This fork
A fork of [xikhar/spiderbench](https://github.com/xikhar/spiderbench), kept up to date with it. It adds:

- **Manual reel:** while swinging, hold **Shift** to reel the web in and climb, or **C** / **Ctrl** to let it out and skim the street. On a gamepad, use D-pad up / down.
- **Auto swing:** press **B** and he swings through the city on his own, following the streets. **N** switches between four styles: Cruise, Dive, Acrobat and Skim. The mouse still turns the camera, and **B** gives the controls back. Crimes are switched off while it runs. Add `?auto` (or `?auto=<style>`) to the URL to start with it on, and `?autoseed=<n>` to repeat the same route.
